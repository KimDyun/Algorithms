# A telephone directory

## Description:
        I'd like to check if there is one of the phone numbers in the phone book which is a prefix of another number.
        If the phone numbers are as follows, the rescue team's phone number is prefix of Young-seok's phone number.
        '''
        * rescue team : 119
        * Jun-young : 97 674 223
        * Young-seok : 11 9552 4421
        '''
        When 'phone_book' which is an array(list) containing phone numbers is given
        as a parameter of the solution method, write the solution method to return false if there is a phone number
        which is a prefix of another number, or return true if not.

## Restrictions:
        1. Length of phone_book array is more than 1 and less than 1,000,000
        2. Length of each phone number is more than 1 and less than 20
        3. The same phone numbers cannot exist in the telephone directory
